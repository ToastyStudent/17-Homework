# Regular Expression (Regex) Tutorial - Matching an Email

In this tutorial, I will be walking you through the regular expression, or regex for short, pattern for validating/matching an email address.

## Summary

Specifically, I'll break down each of regex components and explain their role in the validation process of an email. 

Hopefully, by the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding grasp of email validation with regular expressions, allowing you to do so in the futue on your own.

To start, here is the Regex Pattern for an Email:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

Firstly, before delving into the regex components themselves, important to note is that a regex is considered a literal, so any regex patterns must be wrapped in slash characters (/), i.e there must be a slash on either end of them.

That of emails is no different, as evidenced below:

<font color="Red"><b>/</b></font>^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$<font color="Red"><b>/</b></font>
